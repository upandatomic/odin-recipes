        <h3>Cabbage roll with mince meat and rice</h3>
        <p>For this satisfying sarma dish, cabbage leaves are stuffed with a seasoned mixture of rice, ground beef, pork, and ham. They are then laid on a bed of sauerkraut and simmered to completion. This is the best stuffed cabbage recipe I've ever tried.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large head cabbage</li>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1/2 pound ground pork</li>
            <li>1/2 pound ground ham</li>
            <li>1 cup uncooked long-grain white rice</li>
            <li>1 onion, finley chopped</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 tsp sale</li>
            <li>1 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 pound sauerkraut</li>
            <li>1 cup tomato juice</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove the leaves from the head of cabbage</li>
            <li>Mix beef, pork, ham, uncooked rice, onion, egg, salt, pepper, and garlic powder together in a bowl until well combined. Form mixture into oblong balls, using 1/2 cup of the mixture at a time. Wrap a cabbage leaf around each ball.</li>
            <li>Spread sauerkraut in the bottom of a large pot. Layer cabbage rolls on top, placing them seam-side down. Pour tomato juice over rolls, then add enough water to cover and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 3 hours, adding more water as necessary.</li>
